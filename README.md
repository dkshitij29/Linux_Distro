# Linux_Distro

As part of CIS 578, I am planning to build a Linux distro for my final project.

## Resources:
* LFS (Linux From Scratch): [Link](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

## Currently:
Following this page: [link](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/)

## Outcomes and Expectations:

* This is a side project that can showcase and improve my profile.

* Research Outcomes: 
    - It can be used to measure user satisfaction in using a custom-tailored distro versus a more generalized approach.
    - Linux is a monolithic kernel, but we can experiment with a hybrid approach that blends monolithic architecture and microkernel architecture.

**Disclaimer**: This is not an innovation-based project. The pace of groundbreaking changes may have slowed; now it's more about optimization, cloud, and microservices.
